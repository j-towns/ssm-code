Code to reproduce the experiments from the short paper [Lossless compression with state space models using bits back coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10150), by myself and [Iain Murray](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/imurray2/).

Requires Python >= 3.7, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, [Autograd](https://github.com/hips/autograd) and [Craystack](https://github.com/j-towns/craystack).
